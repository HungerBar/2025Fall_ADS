# Data Generator

Generate data and save it in the `testcases` directory.

## `dfsGenerator.py`

### Data Features

- All values are drawn from the base range `[maxv/3, maxv/2]` with minimal perturbations of ±3.
  → **Elements are extremely close to each other**, making it difficult to prune branches through sorting or rapid pruning techniques.
- Values are completely shuffled randomly.
  → Eliminates regular structures, leading the DFS algorithm to consider "success still possible" at most nodes.
- Result: **Approaches the worst-case scenario for DFS + pruning**, forcing the algorithm to explore a large number of branches. Ideal for testing the extreme performance of algorithms.

### Generate Test Set

```bash
python dfsGenerator.py --ns 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 --repeat 5
```

--ns: Values of n (array length)
--repeat: Number of repetitions for each n value

Generated File Format:

```
testcases/dfs1.in
testcases/dfs2.in
...
```

## `dp_fixednGen.py`

Generates integer test data with a **fixed array length** and specified total sums. Elements are constrained within the range `[min_val, max_val]`. Results are saved in files formatted like `input.txt`, supporting multiple total sums and repeated trials.

### Usage Example

In practice, set `n=50`, sums as 10002, 20001, ..., 1000002 (ensuring each sum is a multiple of 3), and `trials=5`.

```bash
python dp_fixednGen.py --n 10 --sums 100 200 --trials 3 --output_dir testcases
```

Files generated under `testcases/` follow the naming convention `dp1_1.in`, `dp1_2.in`, etc. Each file has:

- First line: Array length `n`
- Second line: The generated integer array

## `dpfixeSumGen.py`

Generates integer arrays with a **fixed length `n`** and a specified total sum. Each element is guaranteed to be within the valid range. Results are saved as `dp2_i.in` files, supporting multiple `n` values and repeated trials.

### Usage Example

In practice, set `ns` from 100 to 1000 and `total_sum=24000`.

```bash
python dp2_generate.py --ns 50 100 200 --total_sum 24000 --trials 5 --output_dir testcases
```

File format is consistent with `dp_fixednGen.py`:

- First line: Array length `n`
- Second line: The generated integer array

## `dpTimeGen.py`

Generates random integer arrays of length `n`, where elements fluctuate around a mean value (i.e., `mean ± noise`). Results are saved as `dp3_i.in` files, supporting multiple `n` values and repeated trials. File format matches that of `dp2`-series generators.

### Usage Example

In practice, set `n_list` as 50, 100, ..., 450 and `trials=5`.

```bash
python dp3_generate.py --n_list 50 100 200 --trials 5 --output_dir testcases
```

## `BaseGen.py`

Generates small-scale strictly solvable arrays for subsequent combination tasks. Each array is verified for solvability using legacy code (`./dp` + `./check`and these are the old version of codes, so it can't be generate again conveniently).

### Usage

```bash
python BaseGen.py
```

Output files are saved in `testcases/` as `base_1.txt` to `base_20.txt`. Large arrays are generated by randomly selecting several base arrays and multiplying them by random scaling factors. This supports combining multiple groups to create high-difficulty test cases. Final outputs are stored as `sa1_1.in` to `sa1_10000.in` in the `testcases/` directory.

## `GreedyGen.py`

This script generates **large random array test sets guaranteed to be partitionable into 3 equal sum buckets**, while recording basic information for each test instance.

### Function Overview

- Automatically generates a specified number of large arrays (`NUM_GUARANTEED_INPUTS`, default: 1000), each with a fixed length `N_LARGE` (default: 1000).
- Elements are within the range `[MIN_VALUE, MAX_VALUE]`, and the total sum of each array is strictly divisible by the number of buckets (`NUM_BUCKETS`), ensuring a valid partition solution exists.
- Each generated array is saved to a file named `testcases/sa_i.in`. A CSV file is also generated to record key metrics: array length, target bucket sum, minimum/maximum element values, average value, filename, and generation timestamp.

### Usage

```bash
python GreedyGen.py
```
